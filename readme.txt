The custom post type:
Your custom post type is the Specials section in the dashboard. To access it hover over the Elanor Bistro link at the top of the page press dashboard. 
On the left side there is a navigation menu. You will find Specials there. Click on Specials. To add new specials click on Todays Specials at the top. Give your
item a title and scroll down to the featured image section. Add a featured image. This image will display on your page at the bottom inside the "Today's Special" section. 

Here is a detailed breakdown of how to use the shortcodes:
A shortcode is a small piece of code that you can use to display posts from the Specials section. To activate it type [hcw-shortcode]: this will display a post from the
Specials section. To view what that looks like go to the menu page. If you want to give your shortcode a title do [hcw-shortcode] Add Title [/hcw-shortcode]
